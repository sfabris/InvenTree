            Normally, a web-based session would use csrftoken based authentication.
            However when running an external application (e.g. the InvenTree app),
            we wish to use token-based auth to grab media files.

            So, we will allow token-based authentication but ONLY for the /media/ directory.

            What problem is this solving?
            - The InvenTree mobile app does not use csrf token auth
            - Token auth is used by the Django REST framework, but that is under the /api/ endpoint
            - Media files (e.g. Part images) are required to be served to the app
            - We do not want to make /media/ files accessible without login!

            There is PROBABLY a better way of going about this?
            a) Allow token-based authentication against a user?
            b) Serve /media/ files in a duplicate location e.g. /api/media/ ?
            c) Is there a "standard" way of solving this problem?

            My [google|stackoverflow]-fu has failed me. So this hack has been created.
